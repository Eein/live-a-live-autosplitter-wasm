# Live A Live WASM Autosplitter

A multiplatform autosplitter for Live a Live (PC)

## Supported Features
- Auto start timer on character select
- Auto start timer when selecting NEW GAME
- Game Time through loading removal (not accurate)
- Split on next chapter start (only when timer is running)

# TODO:
- [~] Character Story Splits
   - partially done in `revamp` branch, going through to get scenario ids
- [ ] Full game ending splits
    - [ ] final boss end flash (this is going to be a nightmare)
- [ ] TODO: Determine a better way to handle Present Day defeated enemies.
  - intVars + in controller Face icons dont work for last enemy (since the game does this intentionally so you can reload the save)
  - Maybe add a collective split when the odie kill animation starts.
  - [ ] map id change for starting odie.

## Install

Go to "Edit Splits", and make sure Live a Live (2022) is selected as the game name, and click "Activate" then click "Settings" to change your splits.

## Manual Install

Go to release page and select a release and add Auto Splitting Runtime component and add the file manually.

### For Any% Good Ending Runs

Select Automatic Start on New Game

Select "Start {Chapter name}" for all spits *except* the first characters split, unless you have a "menu split" before that character select.

Note: In the future, preconfigured autosplitter and splits file may be provided in the community discord/src page.

Ending split must be done manually for now.

### For Individual Level Runs

Select Automatic Start on character select

Ending split must be done manually for now.

### NOTE
